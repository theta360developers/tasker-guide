With this combination you are able to take pictures and configure camera settings in the field with a custom workflow using an Android phone or tablet where you may be putting the camera in a car with one hand and holding the phone in your other hand. Similar apps are also available for iOS.</p> <p>This may be an easy way to prototype workflows specific to the industry you are working in, before doing final development on your app.</p> <p>To send HTTP Requests with HTTP Request Shortcuts I followed this article Using the THETA Web API without programming (Remote photo app) and if you need further information to reference I have an article testing the RICOH THETA Web API with HTTP Requests Shortcuts here Testing RICOH THETA Web API via Android Mobile App.</p> <p>Tasker is going to be used to execute a set of API commands automatically from HTTP Request Shortcuts and group them together so we can organize a set of custom API requests into one group and press one button to set them off sequentially. We can also set that group of commands from tasker into a home screen shortcut!</p>"},{"location":"#camera","title":"Camera","text":"<pre><code>Name: RICOH THETA X\nFirmware: 1.41.0\n\nReset camera\n    Can be done through LCD on camera or using the API\n\nDelete all media on camera\n    Can use USB cable, connect to Windows, delete through Windows explorer\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#device-connected-to-camera","title":"Device connected to Camera","text":"<pre><code>Device: Samsung Galaxy Tab A8\nModel Name: SM-X200\nAndroid Version: 13\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#apps-used","title":"Apps Used","text":"<ul> <li>Tasker</li> <li>HTTP Request Shortcuts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<ul> <li>THETA Web API v2.1</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#general-steps","title":"General Steps","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Get Deep-linking URL from HTTP Shortcuts app</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Tasker App to Run Commands Sequentially</p> </li> <li> <p>Add Tasker Commands to Device Home Screen</p> </li> <li> <p>Exporting Task as Link to share with others</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"export-tut/","title":"Exporting Task as a Link","text":"<p>In the Tasker App</p> <ol> <li> <p>Go to the Tasks Tab at the top</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Hold down the Task you want to share</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Press on \"Export\" at the top right and Press on \"As Link\"</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Add Tags as required, and Optionally add a description, or make it Public on Taskernet where you can view other Tasker Shares</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Press the back arrow and your done!
